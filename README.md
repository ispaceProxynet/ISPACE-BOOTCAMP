# ISPACE-BOOTCAMP
To reach out to parents and students about the upcoming bootcamp
Ispace Club will be holding its 1st Edition of CodeLife Africa Bootcamp 2019 during the Easter holiday for students in primary and secondary school.
Codelife Africa Bootcamp, is an intensive 2-weeks Information Technology training program which is geared at bridging the technology literacy gap while actively churning out future innovators for the digital space. We hope to achieve this through our localized curriculum coupled with the strength of our well-trained facilitators. The bootcamp curriculum is designed to prepare students for junior developer role with the option of allowing students to also take individual modules at their own pace
Participants will learn the fundamentals of web design, animation, robotics, game design, 3D printing, and 3D design into its Easter camp curriculum using tools such as Google CSFirst and a curriculum that is cutting edge. They range from Levels 1-3 (beginner, intermediate, advanced). By the time participants complete the course, they will be confidently coding and ready to take on their next programming challenge.
This bootcamp includes opportunities for individual and group projects, hands-on demos, and lectures. Participants can expect to build fully functional web-apps, websites, collect data, and use development tools to complete their projects.
There will be an online support after the boot camp through our slack channel.
Enroll your children for our bootcamp for primary and secondary schools, ages 7 -17 years this Easter holiday to learn. We need to develop a maker culture in our young ones and tilt the balance of technology consumption in favor of its production by Nigerians for Nigerians.
